# ShellFusion Tool Readme

This is a tool demo demonstration of our work ShellFusion. In this README, we provide a walkthrough of our tool demonstration. Generally, it takes three steps to deploy the ShellFusion website on a Linux platform, as described below.

## Introduction of ShellFusion
In our paper, we have implemented ShellFusion as a standalone web-based tool to help users address shell programming tasks by recommending relevant shell commands and comprehensive answers. The tool is consists of two parts: the `Backend` and the `Frontend User Interface`.
### Backend
The backend is responsible for the answer generation by leveraging the dataset we built. The dataset we provide contains:
 - Shell-related Quesions
 - the Word Embedding Model.
 - the IDF Vocabulary
 - The shell commands with options detected from the accepted answers of the questions
 - The matrix representations of the questions
 - The Elasticsearch index of the questions

Based on the datasets, the function of the Backend includes Similar Question Retrieval, Shell Command Detection, Filtering & Ranking and Answer Generation.
### Frontend User Interface
We develop the frontend of ShellFusion using the `Vue CLI 3` framework. It's responsible for obtaining the query and presenting the answer in a clean and understandable way.
## Deployment Walkthrough
It requires five steps to deploy the tool. 
### Step 1: Start Elasticsearch Using Docker.

The first step is to start an Elasticsearch service using Docker. We release the Elasticsearch configuration file `elasticsearch.yml` in the **ShellFusion-backend** folder. The Elasticsearch service can be started by  
```sh
docker run -it --name es01 --ipc=host -p 9200:9200 -v {yourpath}/elasticsearch.yml:/config/elasticsearch.yml docker.elastic.co/ elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.0.0
``` 
If the service start succesfully, the output will be as ![Elasticsearch](https://github.com/QuinVIVER/ShellFusion-tooldemo/blob/main/figs/fig5.jpg?raw=true) 
We need to note down the `password for the elastic user` generated by the service for later usage. 

> In our experiment, Elasticsearch service requires up to 32G of ram, and the disk has more than 20% spare space for appropriate functioning, or it won't start.

### Step 2: Download Datasets and Build the Elasticsearch Index.

In this step, we first need to download the dataset of ShellFusion.
```sh
wget http://8.134.73.140:30021/exp_manual.tgz
wget http://8.134.73.140:30021/exp_models_dir.tgz
wget http://8.134.73.140:30021/exp_posts_dir.tgz
```
After downloading the tar files, we need to unpack the backend folder and unpack them into the **ShellFusion-backend** folder. 
Then to build the Elasticsearch index, we need to navigate into the **ShellFusion-backend** folder, change `<yourpassword>` in line 17 of `online/ES.py` to the password we obtain in step 1, and run
``` sh
python3 online/ES.py --config config.yml
```
> if you're not deploying the Elasticsearch service on localhost, change the ip address in line 17 of `online/ES.py`.
### Step 3: Deploy the Frontend
We first need to install `nginx` and the `Node.js` framework, then navigate into **ShellFusion-backend** folder, run the command below to install the frontend dependencies. 
```sh
npm install
```
After that, we generate the frontend package, move the generated package to the nginx folder and reload nginx by running
```sh
npm run build
mv dist /usr/share/nginx/html
nginx -s reload
```
Now we can access the homepage of ShellFusion via the link `localhost:8001`. Note that we configure Nginx to show the homepage on port 8001. The configuration file `nginx.conf` can be found in the **ShellFusion-backend** folder.

### Step 4: Deploy the Backend

First, navigate into the **ShellFusion-backend** folder, install the backend dependencies running
 ```python
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```
Then, deploy the backend.
```sh
python3 online/backend.py --config config.yml
```
> In practice,we recommend using screen or other approach to ensure the persistence of the Backend.

## Usage
To use the ShellFusion tool, user just need to input there code-related query into the input box and click the search button, the tool will then return the generated answer.
For user to better understand the usage of the tool, we offered an example query: `How to extract the first two characters of a string in shell scripting`. The answer for the example query as below:
